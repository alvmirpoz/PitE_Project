# Description
We want to predict whether a person will claim from the vehicle insurer, based primarily on demographic data. We trained several different Machine Learning models and created a website with Django in which we are able to see the results of the training of the models, as well as enter our data and it will predict whether we would claim to the insurer or not.

# Requirements
The requirements to be able to deploy the project correctly are (_we also add the versions that were used during the development, they do not necessarily have to be these for it to work_):

- Django (_4.1.4_)
- matplotlib (_3.6.2_)
- numpy (_1.23.0_)
- pandas (_1.5.2_)
- scikit_learn (_1.2.0_)
